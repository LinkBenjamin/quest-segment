hints:
- "To connect a source to a destination, go to the catalog -> functions -> create function"
- "To perform a post request to the webhook url, you can use the `fetch` method. You can find more information about it in the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)."
- "To put data in the fetch request use: `body: JSON.stringify({event: 'segment_destination'})`"
