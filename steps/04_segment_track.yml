learningObjectives: 
- Learn how to track events in Segment

hints:
- "To fire a new event, you can use the `analytics.track()` method. You can find more information about it in the [Segment documentation](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/#track)."
- "The event name should be `button_clicked` and the properties should be `{ button: 'sign up' }`"
- "To find the event time, use the raw data of the event. You can find it in the debug tab of the source page."

      - text: "Let's fire a new event called `button_clicked` when a user clicks on the sign up button."
      - text: "After you fire the event, go to the source page and go to the debug tab. You should see the event there."
      - text: ":instruction[Once you see it send me the time when the event was fired.]"
